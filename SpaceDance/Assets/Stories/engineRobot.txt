The captain radioed the engine room to tell you that we needed {full | all | partial | more} power directed to the {aft | port | starboard | bow} thrusters.
Always loyal to the captain you did all you could.
The impact took out the {liquid oxygen | hydrogen | nitrogen | antimatter} line and the control panel.
You lost power to the main engines and our thrusters misfired throwing us into an erratic {spin | wobble | tumble | flip}.
That {fractured | snapped | collapsed | cracked} part of the hull.
We became became ballistic.
A twirling object in space.
The fuel line is still {ruptured | disconnected | missing | gone}.
Presumably it is floating around {fifty | one hundred | one thousand | a few} miles back.
The {life support | galley | sewage | hot tub} systems used the same kind of piping.
Thank god we found this ship at Ikea.
If you {reweld | replace | fix | modify} the pipes maybe we can fly again.
