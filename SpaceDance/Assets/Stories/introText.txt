So stop me if you have heard this before...
But, on a derelict spaceship floating through space there lived five robots.
You are the Robard, the entertainment robot full of song and dance.
It is your job to entertain the passengers but there are no passengers left.
There has not been any life on this ship for {years | weeks | centuries | decades}.
They all tried to abandond the ship.
None of the people living on board made it.
There was a twenty nine strong robot crew on this ship before the disaster.
Only five of you remain.
Flying through the stars there was a {frieghter | cruiser | shuttle | yacht}: 
A starship filled with {ore | merriment | passengers | robots}. 
The USS Malvern flew the stary skies for {a hundred | a thousand | many | a few} years before.
The crew did as a crew does maintaining the ship for all.
The people on board were en route from a mission the final leg back {home | to base | to debrief | to relax}.
