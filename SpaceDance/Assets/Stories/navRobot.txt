You were the ship's main nav computer.
You tried to thread a needle that no buccaneer would dare to follow.
The captain's wife was on her deathbed and he wanted to get home quick.
You've flown the width and breadth of the {galaxy | system | sector | quadrant} for many years.
Your radar systems were {top of the line | damaged | sufficient | inoperable}.
The charts for this area were {accuracte | recent | corrupted | outdated}.
The gyroscope was on the fritz, we didn't know which we were pointing.
Our star trackers were {fogged up | clear as day | askew | loose} but it didn't matter anyways.
We collided and the next thing we knew we were drifting.
The ship has a fixed sextant that can be used to regain some of our navigational capabilities.
You'll need to reorient the star tracker first and then you can use the sextant to take the angles between stars.
If we get our navigation systems back then we might be able to get home.
