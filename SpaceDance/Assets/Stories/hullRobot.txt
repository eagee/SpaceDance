When all went to hell you were called on to keep the ship together.
The ship was going to break into {two | five | ten | fifty} pieces.
The integrity of the hull was your responsibility.
It was your first serious repair job.
The shields had never failed before.
Back at home you were only responsible for {painting | window cleaning | inspections | space barnacles}.
When the hull began to degrade you were the one to try to keep it together.
The ship's cargo was {overloaded | too light | poorly secured | empty}.
This meant that the hull was already under undue stress.
When the thrusters misfired the hull broke.
You need to crawl through the {maintenence cooridors | ventilation in the hull | break in the hull | window} to begin repairs.
You can get patches for the rupture from the {doors | hatches | interior walls | deckplating} left over from the people who used to live here.
If our ship is whole again then maybe we can go home.
