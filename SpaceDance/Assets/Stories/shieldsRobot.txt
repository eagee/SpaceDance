You are the shields robot the kept the shields running and the ship strong before the rogue {shock wave | gravitational well | asteroid | space whale} hit.
Before this the only job you had to do was keep things safe when the occasional {space junk | lost baggage | wreckage | rock} ran into the ship.
You were a {proud | simple | functional | skilled} robot that kept people safe.
You did your job well, you were a good robot.
The people around you would dance and sing with me.
You felt like you could protect them and keep the ship alive.
When disaster struck the shields {flickered | phased | dropped | crashed}.
There was nothing to protect the hull and the ship lost power.
You used your emergency power reserve to power the shields to buy the passengers a precious few {seconds | minutes | hours | days}
That was the last you knew.
None of them made it and we lost most of our crew.
We can't fly without shields so we can't go home until they're fixed.
